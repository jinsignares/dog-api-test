This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

## Packages used

I used the tools I feel most familiar with. Those being: 

<<<<<<< Updated upstream
    - NextJS: I've been using NextJS lately for all my projects. I find it immensely faster than a regular React App.
    - TailwindCSS: I find it more intuitive than Bootstrap. I've used Bootstrap in the past until I started useing TailwindCSS.
    - useSWR: I use it along with axios to handle all my data fetching. I usually handle state management with Redux but this being a pretty small project I used useSWR to handle  intermediate loading or validation states.

## Funcionality

Just by pressing the random button the user will see a random dog picture. 

I also implemented an input select to give the user the option of choosing a breed of its choice.
